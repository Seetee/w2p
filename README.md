What To Play - A service that compares your game lists from services like Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Origin, Desura and others with those of your friends to give you a suggestion of what games you all have and can play. We will start with one or two, and continue with the others as we get the time. This is a backburner-project that we play with when we have the time.

This is the Drupal sub-theme for that project.
